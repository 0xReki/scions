title: I'm Stuck
---
Well, I'm stuck, but I'm still on it.
Meanwhile, I can publish the side story I came up with earlier on this site.
I also seems like the comment system is stuck.
I'll have to look into it later.
Until then, comments might take some days until they appear.

{% assign page = site.pages
  | where: "type", "chapter"
  | where: "book.series", "Crystal Down: Scions"
  | where: "book.number", 1
  | where: "chapter", 0
  | first %}

[{{ page.title }}]({{ page.url | absolute_url }}){:.btn .btn-block .btn-primary .btn-lg}
<!--more-->
