<p>A few days later, Uncle Alexander goes shopping with us in the capital. After an inspection at the gate, we enter the city. Apparently, the guard is a Kouniklanthrope.</p>

<p>“You should register at the Adventurers’ Guild,” Uncle Alexander says, “you can take all kinds of jobs there. If you like, I can nominate you for taking care of the Slimes on our farm.”</p>

<p>“We can do that even without taking it via the guild,” I answer.</p>

<p>“No, no, no, no. You need to be properly compensated for your work. After all, I’m only providing you with a place to live. The farm is growing and I’d have to hire other adventurers if you refuse.”</p>

<p>“But…” Aiden protests. I agree with him. We have to repay him…</p>

<p>“Sigh… If you’re so insistent, then how about buying some groceries from time to time?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course! We will do that!” Aiden and I answer in unison.</p>

<p>We are led to an armour shop.</p>

<p>“Welcome, what can I do for you?” the shopkeeper, a Dwarf, asks, “Alexander, didn’t do retire from adventuring?”</p>

<p>“I did. We’re getting some starting gear for those two kids I’m taking care of. Officially, they are Swift’s little brothers,” Uncle Alexander answers. He hands him a package, “he sent this for you.”</p>

<p>After inspecting the package, he smiles and turns towards us.</p>

<p>“Those are sure some big shoes to fill. My name is Glorindamli!”</p>

<p>“Nice to meet you, Gr…, I mean, Go…” I try to pronounce his name… it’s too hard! “Gromli…, no, that’s not right, I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“Gromli is fine,” he says, “in fact, most non-Dwarves call me that,” he smiles.</p>

<p>“Nice to meet you, Gromli! I’m Ethan,” I introduce myself, “this is my elder twin brother Aiden.”</p>

<p>“Nice to meet you,” Aiden answers.</p>

<p>“So basic gear for the two of you… So a set of archer armour and set of swordsman armour,” Gromli discerns.</p>

<p>“How did you know that?” I ask.</p>

<p>“Experience, lots of experience. You seem to have gotten formal training, too. So that makes it even easier,” Gromli explains.</p>

<p>He’s good! He fits us with equipment. Aiden gets light grey gear and I receive dark grey gear.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about the payment,” he says, “your big brother already arrangement payment for you.”</p>

<p>“He did?” Aiden asks.</p>

<p>“Yes, he sent a crate of his newest batch of maple ale. Every time he makes it somehow it gets better!” Gromli boasts, “though I still don’t know how he makes ale without Huffin.”</p>

<p>Gromli inspects our weapons, “those weapons… I see. The ones you have should last for while. Your village went all in on those.”</p>

<p>“Our village? You know it?” Aiden asks.</p>

<p>“Of course, I do. When I was still travelling I befriended one of them. Those are very special weapons. They made your weapons so half-baked people won’t be able to spot the quality of those weapons. They aren’t cheap. They are made to look cheap so you don’t get targeted by others. From what I can see they must treasure you a lot.”</p>

<p>“Thanks a lot for your help, Gromli,” Aiden and I say.</p>

<p>“Thank me by not failing your guild examinations!” he answers, “Good luck!” </p>
