<p>“Oho, you both pass!” he says, “It’s still rough but you’re on a good way. I think your ability is already enough for at least Bronze-7. But you still have to start at the beginning with Bronze-<ruby class="text-nowrap"><rb>X</rb><rp> (</rp><rt></rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>.</p>

<p>Given you’re diligent with your work you should reach that rank very soon. By the way, I’m Irving, the Guild Master. Sorry for being so harsh earlier. But some kids don’t take the assessment seriously when I’m too friendly.”</p>

<p>So he’s the Guild Master. Is it big bro Swift’s influence or Uncle Alexander’s influence?</p>

<p>“I guess, you’ll form a party. Have you already decided on a party name?”</p>

<p>“Not really,” I answer, “how about ‘The Children of Light and Darkness’?”</p>

<p>“That has a certain ring to it,” he answers.</p>

<p>After accompanying us to the reception counter, the Guild Master has the clerk issue our cards.</p>

<p>“Limit them to lower bronze for now,” he says.</p>

<p>The clerk puts transparent cards with our names on the table and gives us needles.</p>

<p>“I need a drop of blood on those cards to attune these cards to you.”</p>

<p>We do so. The Magic imbued in the cards make the cards shine for a brief moment. The clerk picks up the cards.</p>

<p>“By the way, I’m Lynette Taru. I will explain how your Guild Cards work. With these, you can view your own status at any time. These can also serve as your identification. If someone who’s not their owner holds the card for more than <ruby class="text-nowrap"><rb>X</rb><rp> (</rp><rt></rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> seconds it turns translucent.”</p>

<p>Just as she says it, the card turns completely translucent. She hands us our cards.</p>

<p>“But if you get it back it will become the correct colour again.”</p>

<p>And it does turn back to bronze.</p>

<p>“When showing it to other people you are the ones that decide what information is to be displayed. It’s common to hide everything but your name, your party and your level. Please don’t lose those! Reissuing them costs money depending on your rank but at least one Gold Coin.”</p>

<p>I look at my card. The name registered is Aiden Mittens. Our party name isn’t on the card. It’s probably not registered yet. I decide to ask.</p>

<p>“We have decided to form a party. We have decided to go with the name ‘The Children of Light and Darkness’”</p>

<p>“I see, who is the party leader? Usually, it’s the eldest or most capable person. Naturally, for fixed parties, you can choose someone else as well.”</p>

<p>“You do it, big brother,” Ethan says.</p>

<p>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m counting on you.”</p>

<p>“OK, I’ll do it.”</p>

<p>“Since that is settled, give me your Guild Cards for a minute for registering the party.”</p>

<p>After Lynette finishes processing our cards, she suggests some quests.</p>

<p>“You can take multiple quests at once. Since the party registration is done it doesn’t matter who reports to the guild. While those quests don’t really require a party, but they still count towards the whole party. How about taking some?”</p>

<p>“Thanks for the offer but we’ll come back tomorrow for that,” I answer.</p>

<p>“I see, see you tomorrow then.”</p>

<p>We wait for Uncle Alexander to finish his own business a the counter and leave the guild with him to go home. </p>
