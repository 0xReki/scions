Big Bro Swift and Big Bro Pat see us off.
Ethan and I leave the forest together with Uncle Alexander and Big Bro Matt.
We follow the path out of the forest.
It has turned into a proper road now.

“Come to think of it.
How come Big Bro Matt does the documentation for us?” I ask.

“Well, I might as well tell you. My full name is Matthew Sitnalta, I'm the second prince of Sitnalta.”

“The second prince?! But… but…” I stutter.

Prince Matthew laughs.

“As long as you don't expect any favours I'm just big brother Matt to you.
I hope it can stay that way.”

“Of course, thank you very much!
But if you're the second prince then what about Big Bro Swift? And Big Bro Pat?”

“Swift is the keeper of the Crystal Down — he's been chosen by the gods for that position.
He sent his aide, Patrick, for my help right after he received a revelation of the two of you appearing.
I believe the temple would have helped if he asked them.
In hindsight, asking me was the best option, since we have the need to change your names.
We were toying with the idea of sheltering you in the palace, but decided against.”

“Because it would get you into trouble with Krale Kingdom?”

“No no, on paper, you don't even exist.
Krale can't do anything without admitting you exist.
With the proper documentation on our, they can't touch you anymore.
All the more with Swift becoming your guardian.

I was on the way to the forest when I met Alexander.
He suggested taking care of you if you were to accept.

But you're right. It's better to not to wake a sleeping bear.”

We reach a farm.
There are Slimes jumping about.

“This is my place,” Uncle Alexander says, “as you can see, it's a Slime Farm.
If fed the correct food Slimes produce Slime Gelatine which is used in Fruit Jelly.
You got some from Swift didn't you?”

“Fruit Jelly? It was tasty!
It's made from Slime Gelatine?
Shouldn't that be a secret or something?” I ask.

“No, the recipe is not a secret.
It's just what you feed the Slimes to make them produce Slime Gelatine that's a secret for now.
That's why we give them different stuff to eat. We also keep a record to see what else they produce.

Swift and I like to experiment with food and create new foods.
So if you got any ideas Swift and I would be happy to listen.”

We enter the main building.
Uncle Alexander leads us to the second floor.

“These will become your rooms.
They aren't fully furnished yet.
But that way you can choose what you want in your rooms.”

“We get separate rooms?” Ethan asks.

“Yes, you do.
Unless you insist on sharing one.”

“I've never thought about it.
For the most part, we've always been together,” I answer, “I don't see any reason, not have separate rooms.”

Ethan's face turns stiff.
Even considering our situation, I didn't know he was this attached to me!
I should humour him.
He is my brother — the only family I still have — after all.

“But there's no rule you can't come to my room to sleep, from time to time of course,” I add.

Ethan's mood instantly improves.

“In that case, we should get you bigger beds,” Uncle Alexander adds, “for now, I only have beds in the guest room.
We'll go shopping for your stuff after Matt finishes your documentation.
Go unpack and make yourself at home.”

“Thank you again for taking us in,” I say. Ethan follows my lead.

“Don't mention it,” Uncle Alexander says, “in fact, I welcome it. I could use some company here on the farm.”
