A few days later, Uncle Alexander goes shopping with us in the capital.
After an inspection at the gate, we enter the city.
Apparently, the guard is a Kouniklanthrope.

“You should register at the Adventurers' Guild,” Uncle Alexander says, “you can take all kinds of jobs there.
If you like, I can nominate you for taking care of the Slimes on our farm.”

“We can do that even without taking it via the guild,” I answer.

“No, no, no, no.
You need to be properly compensated for your work.
After all, I'm only providing you with a place to live.
The farm is growing and I'd have to hire other adventurers if you refuse.”

“But…” Aiden protests. I agree with him. We have to repay him…

“Sigh… If you're so insistent, then how about buying some groceries from time to time?”

“Yes, of course! We will do that!” Aiden and I answer in unison.

We are led to an armour shop.

“Welcome, what can I do for you?” the shopkeeper, a Dwarf, asks, “Alexander, didn't do retire from adventuring?”

“I did.
We're getting some starting gear for those two kids I'm taking care of.
Officially, they are Swift's little brothers,” Uncle Alexander answers. He hands him a package, “he sent this for you.”

After inspecting the package, he smiles and turns towards us.

“Those are sure some big shoes to fill.
My name is Glorindamli!”

“Nice to meet you, Gr…, I mean, Go…” I try to pronounce his name… it's too hard! “Gromli…, no, that's not right, I'm sorry.”

“Gromli is fine,” he says, “in fact, most non-Dwarves call me that,” he smiles.

“Nice to meet you, Gromli! I'm Ethan,” I introduce myself, “this is my elder twin brother Aiden.”

“Nice to meet you,” Aiden answers.

“So basic gear for the two of you… So a set of archer armour and set of swordsman armour,” Gromli discerns.

“How did you know that?” I ask.

“Experience, lots of experience.
You seem to have gotten formal training, too.
So that makes it even easier,” Gromli explains.

He's good! He fits us with equipment.
Aiden gets light grey gear and I receive dark grey gear.

“Don't worry about the payment,” he says, “your big brother already arrangement payment for you.”

“He did?” Aiden asks.

“Yes, he sent a crate of his newest batch of maple ale.
Every time he makes it somehow it gets better!” Gromli boasts, “though I still don't know how he makes ale without Huffin.”

Gromli inspects our weapons, “those weapons… I see.
The ones you have should last for while.
Your village went all in on those.”

“Our village? You know it?” Aiden asks.

“Of course, I do.
When I was still travelling I befriended one of them.
Those are very special weapons.
They made your weapons so half-baked people won't be able to spot the quality of those weapons.
They aren't cheap. They are made to look cheap so you don't get targeted by others.
From what I can see they must treasure you a lot.”

“Thanks a lot for your help, Gromli,” Aiden and I say.

“Thank me by not failing your guild examinations!” he answers, “Good luck!”
